CHAT DETECTOR FOR MINECRAFT

This tool can be used to detect "The first to type XXX wins!" questions within the Minecraft chat.
These types of questions may appear on several Minecraft servers and this tool can handle them with ease.

It can detect up to 4 words within the question.

Once the successful detection happens, the tool will rapidly send an appropriate response to the Minecraft Chat.
